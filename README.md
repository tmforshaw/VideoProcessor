# VideoProcessor
An image processor which looks for markers and tracks then over the course of a video. Intended for a Newton's cradle.

The program has hard-coded colours which are tracked over time, and analysed using `Python` and reformatted so that the plots of the motion are relative to each marker's equillibrium position.

A modified video file is created after the program is completed, so that verification can be completed, where each marker is highlighted.
